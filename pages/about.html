<h2>About TSAD Taxonomy Project</h2>
<p>
  This web application provides an interactive navigation experience through the literature on time-series anomaly detection. It is designed to support and complement the survey paper 
  <em>“Dive into Time-Series Anomaly Detection: A Decade Review”</em> by Paul Boniol, Qinghua Liu, Mingyi Huang, Themis Palpanas, and John Paparrizos.
</p>
<p>
  With the explosive growth in data collection technologies and the increasing volume and speed of streaming data, time-series analytics have become crucial across many domains. Time-series anomaly detection, in particular, plays a vital role in areas such as astrophysics, environmental science, cybersecurity, and healthcare.
</p>
<p>
  This application helps users explore and understand the vast array of existing methods, ranging from traditional statistical approaches to modern machine learning algorithms. It visualizes a structured, process-centric taxonomy of anomaly detection techniques, enabling a deeper insight into the research landscape.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, it supports the meta-analysis and general trends outlined in the paper, making it easier for researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts to navigate and comprehend this dynamic and evolving field.
