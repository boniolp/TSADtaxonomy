  "description": "The technique is based on an online sequence memory algorithm called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). HTM sequence memory consists of a layer of HTM neurons organized into a set of columns. The network accepts a stream of inputs encoded as sparse vectors. It models high-order sequences (sequences with long-term dependencies) using a composition of two separate sparse representations.",
