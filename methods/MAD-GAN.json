  "description": "Anomaly detection method based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Instead of treating each data stream independently, MAD-GAN framework considers the entire variable set concurrently to capture the latent interactions amongst the variables. Both the generator and discriminator produced by the GAN are fully exploit, using a novel anomaly score called DR-score to detect anomalies by discrimination and reconstruction.",
