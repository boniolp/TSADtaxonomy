  "description": "Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a type of recurrent neural network that use a fixed, randomly connected reservoir of hidden neurons to project input sequences into a high-dimensional space, where only the output weights are trained. This architecture enables efficient modeling of temporal patterns and dynamic systems, making ESNs well-suited for tasks like anomaly detection in time series from sensor networks.",
