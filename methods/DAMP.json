  "description": "DAMP is a matrix-profile–based anomaly detection algorithm designed to efficiently discover discords in large-scale time series. It overcomes limitations such as the twin-freak problem and supports both batch and streaming scenarios, enabling scalable detection from millions to trillions of data points.",
