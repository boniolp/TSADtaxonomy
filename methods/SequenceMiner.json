  "description": "SequenceMiner is an unsupervised, scalable method for detecting and explaining anomalies in large collections of discrete symbol sequences (e.g., cockpit switch activations during aircraft landings). It clusters sequences using a similarity based on the normalized longest common subsequence (nLCS), then identifies anomalies as those sequences with low similarity to their clusterâ€™s medoid.",
