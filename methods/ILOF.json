  "description": "Novel incremental LOF algorithm that is appropriate for detecting outliers in data streams. The paper shows that insertion of new data points as well as deletion of obsolete points influence only limited number of their nearest neighbors and thus insertion/deletion time complexity per data point does not depend on the total number of points in the stream.",
