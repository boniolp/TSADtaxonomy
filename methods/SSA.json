  "description": "SSA (Segmented Sequence Analysis) leverages temporal and spatial correlations in sensor systems measurements and constructs a piecewise linear model of sensor data time series.  To detect anomalies, we compare the piecewise linear models of sensor data (collected during a time interval) and a reference model, where significant differences (as determined by a proposed similarity metric) are flagged as anomalies.
