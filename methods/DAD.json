  "description": "Disk Aware Discord Discovery is an exact algorithm for finding anomalous subsequences (‘discords’) in time series that are too large to fit in memory. It detects discords using just two linear scans of the disk and a small in-memory buffer, offering a simple yet scalable approach to discover unusual patterns in massive datasets like those found in astronomy, web logs, or surveillance.",
