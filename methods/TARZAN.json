  "description": "TARZAN is a method that defines a pattern surprising if the frequency of its occurrence differs substantially from that expected by chance, given some previously seen data. The user has to give a collection of previously observed normal data. A suffix tree is used to encode the frequency and a Markov model is used to predict the expected frequency.",
