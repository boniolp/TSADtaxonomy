  "description": "Hidden Markov Anomaly Detection (HMAD) is an extension of the one-class SVM for data featuring underlying dependency structures. By embedding data and its latent state sequence into a structured joint feature space, HMAD can learn anomaly boundaries while controlling outlier rates.",
