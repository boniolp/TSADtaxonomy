  "description": "Stochastic recurrent neural network for multivariate time series anomaly detection. OmniAnomaly captures the normal patterns of multivariate time series by learning their robust representations with key techniques such as stochastic variable connection and planar normalizing flow, reconstruct input data by the representations, and use the reconstruction probabilities to determine anomalies.
