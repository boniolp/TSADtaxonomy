  "description": "Isolation Forest(iForest) and Local Outlier Factor(LOF) have been widely used for anoamly detection. However, IForest is only sensitive to global outliers, and is weak in dealing with local outliers. Although LOF performs well in local outlier detection, it has high time complexity. A progressive ensemble method for outlier detection is proposed by combining both IForest and LOF.",
