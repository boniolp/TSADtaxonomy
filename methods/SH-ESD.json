  "description": "Some time series might contain relatively high percentage of anomalies. To address such cases, coupled with the fact that mean and standard deviation (used by ESD) are highly sensitive to a large number anomalies, S-ESD is extended to SH-ESD, which use the robust statistics median and median absolute deviation (MAD) to detect anomalies.",
