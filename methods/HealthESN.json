  "description": "Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a type of recurrent neural network that use a fixed, randomly connected reservoir of hidden neurons to project input sequences into a high-dimensional space, where only the output weights are trained. HealthESN is an application of ESN networks for time series anomaly detection in the medical domain.",
