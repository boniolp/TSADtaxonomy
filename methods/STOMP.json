  "description": "Matrix Profile is a fast and scalable technique for time series analysis that computes the distance between all subsequences using the MASS algorithm. It enables efficient discovery of discords (anomalies) and motifs (repeated patterns). In anomaly detection, discords are of particular interest as they represent subsequences that are least similar to any other. STOMP forego the anytime property of the STAMP method to make it significantly faster and easier to leverage GPU hardware.",
