  "description": "OceanWNN combines wavelet neural network (WNN), classifying threshold and two detecting strategies. The WNN is trained without any labeled data to simulate the non-anomalous behaviors for next-step prediction. The classifying threshold was constructed according to the estimated distribution of long-term historical residual errors.",
