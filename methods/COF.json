  "description": "COF (Connectivity-based Outlier Factor) improves upon LOF by computing a chaining-distance among a pointâ€™s k-nearest neighbors and comparing it to the average chaining-distance of those neighbors. A high COF indicates the point is less well-connected and more likely an outlier, allowing better detection of anomalies in regions with similar density but differing connectivity patterns.",
