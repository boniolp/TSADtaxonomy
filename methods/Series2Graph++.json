  "description": "Series2Graph++ is an extension of Series2Graph for multivariate time series. More generally, it is a graph-based anomaly detection algorithm for time series that transforms subsequences into nodes and their transition patterns into edges. The frequency of transitions among types of subsequences is encoded in a directed graph. Anomalies are identified based on irregular transition patterns.",
