  "description": "As the normal operation of a device can usually be characterized in different temporal states, the objective of GeckoFSM is to build a finite state automaton to then detect anomalies. To identify these states,  a clustering algorithm called Gecko that can automatically determine a reasonable number of clusters is used. Then, the RIPPER classification algorithm is used to describe these states in logical rules. Finally, transitional logic between the states is added to create a finite state automaton.",
