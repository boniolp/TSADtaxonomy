  "description": "The SH-ESD+ is intended, but not restricted, to cope with some limitations of SH-ESD and from standard anomaly detection methods. First, it includes robust statistical techniques to minimize the number of false positives and handle effectively with any kind of anomalies on data. It also employs automatic parameter identification procedures to leverage model performance at a low computational cost.",
