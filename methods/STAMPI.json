  "description": "Matrix Profile is a fast and scalable technique for time series analysis that computes the distance between all subsequences using the MASS algorithm. It enables efficient discovery of discords (anomalies) and motifs (repeated patterns). In anomaly detection, discords are of particular interest as they represent subsequences that are least similar to any other. STAMPI is the incremental version of the STAMP method (anytime method to compute the matrix Profile) for streaming applications.",
