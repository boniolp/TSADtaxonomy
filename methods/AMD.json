  "description": "The Adjacent Mean Difference (AMD) method is a parameter-free dynamic segmentation technique for time series anomaly detection. It partitions data into segments of varying lengths by measuring changes between adjacent data pointsâ€™ means, enabling dimensionality reduction and smoothing without a fixed window size. This adaptive segmentation allows more efficient and accurate anomaly detection compared to fixed-length methods like HOT SAX.",
