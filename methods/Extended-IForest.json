  "description": "Extended Isolation Forest generalizes the standard Isolation Forest by replacing axis-parallel splits with randomly oriented hyperplane cuts. At each node, instead of selecting a random feature and split value, EIF picks a random normal vector and a random intercept pointâ€”thereby slicing the data along oblique hyperplanes. This removes the coordinate-axis bias and artifacts present in standard Isolation Forest score maps.",
