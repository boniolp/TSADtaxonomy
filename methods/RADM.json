  "description": "RADM is a real-time anomaly detection algorithm based on Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) and Bayesian Network (BN). First, HTM model is used to evaluate the real-time anomalies of each univariate-sensing time-series. Secondly, a model of anomalous state detection in multivariate-sensing time-series based on Naive Bayesian is designed to analyze the validity of the above time-series.",
