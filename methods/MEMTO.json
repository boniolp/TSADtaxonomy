  "description": "MEMTO is a memory-guided Transformer using a reconstruction-based approach. It is designed to incorporate a novel memory module that can learn the degree to which each memory item should be updated in response to the input data. To stabilize the training procedure, a two-phase training paradigm which involves using K-means clustering for initializing memory items is used. Additionally, a bi-dimensional deviation-based detection criterion that calculates anomaly scores considering both input space and latent space is introduced.",
