  "description": "The proposed approach for cleaning noisy data obtained from a sensor signal is to use the median value of a neighborhood of data points to determine whether a particular data point is an outlier. If we want to identify outliers with only past data, we can use a simple modification of the two-sided median method and look at the first difference of the observed series ",
