  "description": "S-SVM is a SVM approach combined with S-transform methodology. The application of S-transform decomposed the data into its frequency and time components. Then, Four features are extracted from the decomposed data. These features are then passed through SVM which is used as a classifier in S-SVM for identifying anomalies.",
