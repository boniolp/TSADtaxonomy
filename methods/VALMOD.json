  "description": "VALMOD is a scalable motif discovery algorithm (that can also be used for discord discovery) that efficiently finds all motifs in a given range of lengths. Removing the unrealistic assumption that the user knows the correct length, can often produce more intuitive and actionable results, which could have been missed otherwise.",
