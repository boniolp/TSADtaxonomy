  "description": "This paper introduce the concept of a shared density graph which explicitly captures the density of the original data between micro-clusters during clustering and then show how the graph can be used for reclustering micro-clusters. Outliers naturally emerge as points that do not fit into any existing dense micro-cluster or remain in sparse, transient micro-clusters that never accumulate enough density to be considered stable.",
