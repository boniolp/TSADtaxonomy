  "description": "COPOD (Copula-Based Outlier Detection) is a parameter-free anomaly detection algorithm that models multivariate data distribution using empirical copulas. It estimates tail probabilities, interpreted as anomalous p-values, to quantify the extremeness of each data point. COPOD is interpretable, computationally efficient, and effective, often outperforming existing methods across various datasets.",
