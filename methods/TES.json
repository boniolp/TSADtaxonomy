  "description": "Exponential smoothing or exponential moving average (EMA) is a rule of thumb technique for smoothing time series data using the exponential window function. Whereas in the simple moving average the past observations are weighted equally, exponential functions are used to assign exponentially decreasing weights over time. Thus, ES can be used for time series forecasting and anomaly detection. Triple exponential smoothing (TES) is used to handle the time series data containing a seasonal component. This method is based on three smoothing equations: stationary component (ES), trend (DES), and seasonal (TES).",
