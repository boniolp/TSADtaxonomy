  "description": "GrammarViz approach for time series pattern discovery is based on two algorithms that have linear time and space complexity: (i) Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), that discretizes the input time series into a string, and (ii) Sequitur, that induces a context-free grammar (CFG) from it.",
