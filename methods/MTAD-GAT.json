  "description": "MTAD-GAT considers each univariate time-series as an individual feature and tries to model the correlations between different features explicitly, while the temporal dependencies within each time-series are modeled at the same time. The key ingredients are two graph attention layers, namely the feature-oriented graph attention layer and the time-oriented graph attention layer. A a forecasting-based model and a reconstruction-based model is trained for better representations of time-series data.",
